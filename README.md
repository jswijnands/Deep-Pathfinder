# Deep-Pathfinder
This repository provides an implementation of the Deep-Pathfinder algorithm, extracting mixing boundary layer height information from ceilometer data using computer vision techniques.

Note that this script is designed for real-time application, so please replace the NetCDF file with your latest observation data. For real-time inference, the value of the nighttime indicator is set based on the current time when the script is run. If you are interested in analysing historical data, this should be changed.

For full details of the methodology and citation, please refer to: Wijnands, J.S., Apituley, A., Alves Gouveia, D., Noteboom, J.W. (2024).
